###Invitation to the Intentional Company Advance

Greetings. Robbie, Jessy and Chris are writing to invite you to an 'advance' (basically an a retreat, 
but our goal is to advance! not retreat!) on the topic of creating more intentional/conscious companies.

At this point you may be asking, what's an Intentional Company? Well that's what we're planning to 
explore. It's based on a hunch that it may be possible to create some organizational structure able to 
take the best of the for profit and non-profit worlds. That funds its operations by competing in markets, 
but is governed by a more just mission than 'maximizing shareholder value'. To put it another way, much 
has been made lately of corporate personhood - that if companies really were people they'd be psychopathic 
assholes. Our challenge is to see if we can impart some DNA in to companies that would make them nicer - 
the type of people you'd like to meet at a party and hang out with.

**Where:** http://chozadelmundo.com/ in Costa Rica

**When:** The weekend of March 29-31. Before and after you are welcome to spend additional time at the Choza. 

**Goal:** To identify potential key organization and process designs for running an intentional/conscious company. 
(and to brainstorm great names)

**Who:** We're planning for a relatively small group, 10-14 people. We're hoping for a mix of people who are 
running companies and wanting to make them more intentional, people thinking deeply about structures, and 
those that are connectors with great networks who can help in future development of the ideas and hopeful implementation.

**Intended Output:** Will be something to discuss the first day, but we at the least want to report on the 
conversations and start a spot online to aggregate information and collaboration around this topic. The 
first step will be lots of learning, to draw on all that has come before, and to then figure out if there 
is a tangible impact this group can have in advancing better companies. We plan for the whole process to 
be an 'open source' one, with this session being the kick-off in-person 'sprint' of a greater collaborative 
project that will be open to all and primarily organized on the internet.

**Structure:** We will break the three day 'advance' into a series of moderated topical discussion. For each 
topic, there will be a discussant turned moderator and a scribe.  The discussant/moderator will prepare a 
document (summary of topic, longer original writings, articles to read, etc.) and send this around to attendees 
before the event.  At the advance, the discussant will give an summary overview of the topic for ~5 mins, then 
outline a few major questions to address and it becomes a salon.  The discussant will become the moderator for 
the rest of the salon and then become the scribe in the following topic. 

We realize this is somewhat short notice to travel to costa rica. We're mostly hoping to create some space to 
explore ideas and motivate one another to learn more, on a topic that we've seen ignite major passion among a 
select group of people. We hope that by pooling our resources and encouraging one another we can start to explore 
some new organizational structures, instead of punting on the problem because it's hard enough to just find the 
time to be successful at all the other things we're trying to create in the world.

Please RSVP and let us know if you're able to make it, 
Thanks,
Chris Holmes, Robbie Schingler, Jessy Schingler.
